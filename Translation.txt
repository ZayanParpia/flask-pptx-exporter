Haat pehlu pe rakha, aur yeh Zahra ne kaha, mera mohsin na raha
Pasliya tut gayi, aisay darwaza gira, mera Mohsin na raha ....
Pasliya tut ne ka gham he, nhi mujh ko koi
Qatl pehlu mai howe aaj, yeh ik jaan meri
Jeete ji maar gaya, mujhko bus yeh sadma
Mera Mohsin na raha…
Dekha darwaze k niche jo, mujhe rote howe
Pao darwaze pe rak rak ke, sitamgar guzre
Kitni takleef mai bhi, Maine bus Dee yeh sada…
Mera Mohsin na raha
Dar jo pehlu se wo fizza ne, hataya aakar
Boli Zahra mere baccho’n ko, sambhalo Jaa kar
Itna mushkil hai bhot, zulm yeh kaisa howa…
Mera Mohsin na raha...
Jab rasan baand ke gardan se, Ali ko ke’ncha
Aayi zalim se bachne ke liye jab Zehra
Taziyana bhi saha, aur Ali se na kaha
Mera Mohsin na raha...
Ab bhi Zeeshan yeh aati hai, baqiya se sada
Apne mehdi ko bataugi, wo jab aayega
Kitne dukh maine sahe, gham hai yeh sab se bada…
Mera Mohsin na raha…

ENGLISH
Zahra (a.s) placed her hand on her side and said this: “My Mohsin is no more.”
“My ribs are broken, the door fell in such a way, my Mohsin is no more.”
“I have no grief for the breaking of my ribs.”
“This darling of mine has died today in my side (womb).”
“He is dead while I live, just this is the calamity for me.”
“My Mohsin is no more.”
“Seeing that I was crying under the door,”
“Constantly stepping on the door, the oppressor went.”
“Even in such pain, I only gave this cry:”
“My Mohsin is no more.”
When Fizza came and removed the door from Zahra’s (a.s) side,
Zahra (a.s) said to her, “Go and take care of my children.”
“My situation is difficult enough, how did this oppression happen?”
“My Mohsin is no more.”
When the rope was tied around Ali’s (a.s) neck and was pulled,
When Zahra came to save him from the oppressor,
She bore whip lashes, and did not say to Ali (a.s),
“My Mohsin is no more.”
Even now, O Zeeshan, this call comes from Jannatul Baqi:
“I will tell my Mehdi (a.j.t.s) when he comes,”
“How much pain I endured, the greatest sorrow is this:”
“My Mohsin is no more.”
